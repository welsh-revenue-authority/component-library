# Responsive Design

Our breakpoints are developed using a mobile first approach, starting with the smallest screen size of 320px and scaling up to larger screens.

Refer to [tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design) for a full list of instructions on how to utilise custom breakpoints.

## Usage

The component library operates using the following breakpoints:

```
| Breakpoint prefix | Minimum width |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| `xs`              | 320px         |
| `sm`              | 600px         |
| `md`              | 768px         |
| `lg`              | 960px         |
```

Use `--breakpoint-*` theme variables to register our custom breakpoints in Tailwind:

`app.css`

```css
@import "tailwindcss";

@theme {
  --breakpoint-xs: 320px;
  --breakpoint-sm: 600px;
  --breakpoint-md: 768px;
  --breakpoint-lg: 960px;
}
```
